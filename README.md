# Settings API Boilerplate

A heavily commented boilerpate for settings pages in WordPress.

This is a little plugin intended as a demo for the WordPress Settings API.

It contains example of how to create a settings page, basic settings sections and fields, as well as how to store your settings in a single convenient array.

The code is heavily commented, as it should be used for learning purposes.

Just download, activate and play with it. Then copy and paste what you need.

Enjoy !
